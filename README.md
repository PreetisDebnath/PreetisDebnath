Hi there 👋
I’m Preetis Debnath — the non-typical CS nerd who somehow manages coding, designing, singing, swimming, socializing, leading teams and trying not to break my bones while doing calisthenics everyday.

👨‍💻 What I Actually Do
Build dashboards, UIs, and random experiments
Worked on React, HTML/CSS/JS, C, and slowly drag myself into DSA
Create data-visualization projects (Chart.js, Leaflet, etc.)
Pretend I have my life together while debugging

🚀 Current Projects
Travel Analytics Dashboard – interactive charts, filters, heatmaps
Wastemanagement system (basic frontend)
Mental health and pyschological support system (SIH finale project)
More incoming because I have commitment issues with side projects

🌱 Learning (because stagnation is boring)
React + Next.js
Java, Python, C++, C
Figmac Canva, Photoshop & UI/UX
Git & GitHub (yes, properly now)
I also know MS word, excel, access and powerpoint lol
